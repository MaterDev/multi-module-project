# ðŸš€ Multi-Modal Project ðŸš€

![Cover Image](coverImage.png)

The Multi-Modal Project is a comprehensive ðŸŒŸ Scala-based application that demonstrates best practices in organizing and managing complex projects. This project aims to improve code maintainability, readability, and collaboration among team members by using a modular approach.

## ðŸŽ‰ Features

- ðŸ“¦ **Setting up Modules**:
  - Organize your project into smaller, manageable modules. This enhances the separation of concerns and makes it easier to navigate and work on specific parts of the project.

- ðŸ§© **Modularizing build.sbt**:
  - Manage dependencies and settings for each module in a structured way. By modularizing the build.sbt file, you can define module-specific configurations, making it easier to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

- ðŸ”¢ **Using Constants**:
  - Promote the use of constants for values that are shared across different modules. This helps maintain consistency and makes it easier to update values when needed.

## ðŸ“š Modules

Each module has its own source files, build.sbt, and other resources. The main build.sbt file at the root level defines the overall project settings and manages the dependencies for all modules.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with the Multi-Modal Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.
3. Explore the different modules and their respective build.sbt files.
4. Run the main application, and experiment with modifying the modules.

ðŸ’» Happy coding!
